These are the questions I wanted answers to.</p> <p> So I started researching all of the best passive income opportunities. Doing that led me to start this blog, where I now <strong> make six figures per year</strong> .</p> <p> If I can do it, you can too. Here are my top passive income ideas you can use to start earning passive income on your own. </p> <p> In This Article</p> What is Passive Income? How to Generate Passive Income 1. Invest in Land 2.

Rent Your Stuff to Others Summary <h2> <span> What is Passive Income?</span> </h2> <p> <strong> Passive income is income streams you earn from doing little to no work. </strong> You&#8217;ll have to do some upfront work, but then the money just comes in. </p> <p> Sometimes the money keeps coming in due to the type of passive income. Other sources of passive income are passive because you delegate any maintenance work that need to get done.</p> <p> For instance, maintaining a blog like Well Kept Wallet requires daily work. However, we have a team that includes a blog manager, writers, editors and others. So owning a blog isn&#8217;t passive income unless you delegate the duties required to run the blog. </p> <p> Other sources of passive income include &#8220;one and done&#8221; sources of revenue.</p> <p> One way to earn more passive income is to have multiple income streams coming in . In other words, you don&#8217;t just choose one option for earning passive income; you choose two or three or more. </p> <p> <strong> Having multiple income streams is good for two reasons</strong> :</p> You have more money coming in If one income source goes away, you&#8217;re not left without a paycheck <p> Keep that in mind as you read our list of passive income sources.</p> <h2> <span> How to Generate Passive Income </span> </h2> <p> As you start researching about passive income sources, keep in mind the types of passive income streams that are in line with your skills and your passions. </p> <p> There are dozens of ways to build residual income out there. Make sure to find the right ones that match with your time, talents, and passions.</p> <p> <strong> Read on to find your perfect way to earn money while you sleep.</strong> </p> <h3> <span> 1. Invest in Land</span> </h3> <p> Did you know you can earn passive income by investing in land? Of course, you can buy land and rent it out, such as farmland.</p> <p> However, you can also participate in crowdfunded land ownership and rental. </p> <p> Companies like <strong> Acretrader </strong> allow you to purchase shares of farmland. They handle all of the work of administration and property management. </p> <p> <strong> You earn the profits from the farmland being rented out.</strong> Rent for the farmland is paid upfront to reduce the risk of loss from crop failure. Check out AcreTrader today which boasts up to 11.5% annual return!.</p> Learn More <h3> <span> 2. Create Software</span> </h3> <p> Have you thought about using your skills to create software to sell? Spencer Haws created a software program called LongTailPro. </p> <p> LongTailPro is a keyword research software that helps businesses find the right keywords to get high converting traffic to their website or blog. In fact, Spencer makes over 10k a month by selling his LongTailPro software. </p> <p> By partnering with other bloggers and advertising LongTailPro on his own blog, Spencer marketed his software in niches he knew would benefit from the software. </p> <p> One interesting thing about Spencer&#8217;s story is that he hired out via Upwork for all of the development of the software. So he didn&#8217;t actually create the software he sells.</p> <p> He had the idea for what he wanted the software to do, but he hired someone else to do the work of creating the software. </p> <p> So, even if you don&#8217;t necessarily have the skills to make a software program, you can still make this passive income with digital products source work for you. </p> <h3> <span> 3. Purchase Dividend Earning Stocks</span> </h3> <p> Many investors, including Warren Buffett, earn money by owning shares in dividend stocks. </p> <p> Dividend income is money paid to shareholders of stocks in the form of cash. Every quarter or sometimes monthly companies that have dividend-paying stocks issue dividend checks to stockholders.</p> <p> You can reinvest those dividends to buy more shares of stock. Or you can take the money as a paycheck and live off of it. </p> <p> Any time you invest money in the stock market, it&#8217;s important to do your research. You want to know what you&#8217;re doing, so you choose stocks that have a solid history of good performance.</p> <p> Investing in index funds that hold dividend-paying stocks is one option. Index funds are funds that hold stocks from several companies so that not all your eggs are in one basket.</p> <p> Also, many successful investors choose to hold what are called &#8220;blue chip&#8221; dividend stocks. These are stocks in companies that have a long history of success. Think Coca Cola or 3M.</p> <p> If you don&#8217;t have an investment account, <strong> check out M1 Finance because they allow you to trade U.S listed stocks and index funds for FREE. </strong> </p> READ REVIEW SIGN UP <h3> <span> 4. Buy Music Rights</span> </h3> <p> Did you know you can get royalties from music or movies you didn&#8217;t take any part in creating? Royalties are money actors, singers and other artists get when they create a song, TV show or movie.</p> <p> Sometimes those artists want to sell future royalties because they need a lot of money right now. Maybe they want to buy a house or invest in a business. </p> <p> So they sell a portion of their future royalties to investors. The investors make their money back with profits. Companies such as Royalty Exchange work to connect artists with investors.</p> <h3> <span> 5. Invest in Crowdfunded Real Estate</span> </h3> <p> Another great passive income source is through real estate. </p> <p> I&#8217;m not talking about traditional real estate investing. Notably, if you&#8217;re not careful, you can lose big money with traditional real estate investing.</p> <p> When I was younger, I bought two rental properties in hopes of earning passive income via rental real estate. It didn&#8217;t turn out to be very profitable. In fact, I lost a LOT of money.</p> <p> I had a tenant who was late on his rent consistently, I had a hot water tank flood the first floor, and I even had to evict said tenant. </p> <p> There were many expenses I had to deal with, and it took a lot of time to chase after rent I was owed. At the end of it all, I ended up taking a huge loss on the properties.</p> <p> I still believed in real estate as a profitable investment, though, so I decided to check out crowdfunded real estate instead .</p> <p> Many of the platforms out there require you to be an accredited investor, which means you need to have a net worth of $1,000,000 or make over $300,000 per year (if you are married).</p> <p> I wasn&#8217;t an accredited investor at the time, so I knew I needed to search out other options.</p> <p> One company that I came across is called Fundrise .<strong> With only $500 you can get started and invest in real estate.</strong> </p> <p> So far, this is working out well for me. I&#8217;m actually making a profit, and I don&#8217;t have to deal with the headaches of real estate rental ownership.</p> READ REVIEW SIGN UP <h3> <span> 6. Be an Angel Investor</span> </h3> <p> Angel investors provide funding for small startup businesses or entrepreneurs. This could be a good source of passive income if you have a lot of extra cash laying around. </p> <p> When you invest with companies like AngelList, you can invest in specific startups, or you can invest in a basket of startups that is designed similar to an index fund. </p> <p> Minimums for Angel investing products on AngelList range from $1,000 to $500,000. </p> <h3> <span> 7. Loan Money to Others</span> </h3> <p> Have you ever heard of peer-to-peer lending? This is kind of like crowdfunded real estate investing. </p> <p> A group of investors get together and invest money that is loaned to borrowers. As the loan is paid back with interest, you as the investor make money. </p> <p> For instance, a borrower with excellent credit is less of a risk for you to lend money to than one with poor credit. You could choose to invest in lower-risk loans if you want to minimize your chances of losing money.</p> <p> Just know that investing in the lower risk loans will result in a smaller profit. </p> <p> If you are looking for a lower risk option with a decent return, check out <strong> Worthy.</strong> <strong> They offer $10 bonds and pay a 5% return.</strong> One unique thing about them is that your money is liquid, so you can take it out at any time.</p> READ REVIEW SIGN UP <h3> <span> 8. Pay Off Your Debt</span> </h3> <p> A lot of people don&#8217;t think of paying off your debt as a form of passive income. But think about it this way. </p> <p> The less money you’re paying in payments to creditors, the more money you have in your pocket each month. On top of that, getting out of debt quickly can increase your income streams even more because you&#8217;re not wasting money on interest charges from creditors.</p> <p> If you want to get out of debt faster, there are companies that can help you do that. For example, you could <strong> check out Credible, which offers loan rates as low as <p> 3.49% to 35.99%</p> APR with autopay for refinancing your credit card debt</strong> .</p> READ REVIEW SIGN UP <h3> <span> 9. Open a High-Yield Savings Account</span> </h3> <p> This option won&#8217;t make you rich, but it is a way to earn passive income with very little risk. </p> <p> When you choose to open a high-yield account with an online bank, you often earn a higher interest rate that with a traditional bank. This is because online banks have much lower overhead than brick and mortar banks. That means they can pass higher profits on to you.</p> <p> One popular online bank is<strong> CIT Bank,</strong> which pays a much more competitive rate than many traditional banks.</p> <p> Having a high yield checking or savings account can be a good way to earn consistent passive income. Again, the returns are low, but they are a steady way to get free cash back.</p> READ REVIEW SIGN UP <h3> <span> 10. Use the Spare Space in Your House</span> </h3> <p> Does your house or apartment have a spare bedroom? If so, you could make some passive income by renting it out on <strong> Airbnb.</strong> Airbnb is a popular alternative to regular hotels. </p> <p> This is because it&#8217;s often cheaper than regular hotels and provides a more &#8220;homey&#8221; feel for guests. </p> <p> Of course, there is some maintenance involved with this passive income source. You&#8217;ll need to be sure the rooms are cleaned after a guest leaves. However, you could hire a maid to do that. </p> <p> My friends Steve and Annette Economides <strong> make over $1000 per month renting out their spare bedrooms</strong> .</p> READ REVIEW SIGN UP <h3> <span> 11. Start a Drop Shipping Business</span> </h3> <p> It seems that everyone is shopping online these days. Because of that, drop shipping has become very popular . What is drop shipping? </p> <p> Basically, it&#8217;s where you create a site that advertises other companies&#8217; products. </p> <p> A buyer would order the product from your site, which is set up to send the order to the manufacturer of the product automatically. Then the company that makes the product is responsible for shipping the item to the client.</p> <p> With drop shipping, you don&#8217;t have to worry about carrying any inventory. You&#8217;re simply a go-between of a client and a company that makes a profit.</p> <p> If you’re interested in starting a drop shipping business, consider using a platform like<strong> Shopify </strong> to sell your digital products.</p> READ REVIEW SIGN UP <h3> <span> 12. Write a Book</span> </h3> <p> Have you thought about writing a book and then selling books to produce residual income?</p> <p> I did this with a book that I wrote. <strong> You Can Retire Early </strong> will show you how to make the right money moves so you can retire early. For each book that sells, I <strong> get a 10% royalty</strong> .</p> <p> Of course, there is the initial work of writing the book. But after that, you can sell it on Amazon, which, of course, is a major sales platform.</p> <p> Also, you will want to do some marketing. The more marketing you do, the more chances you have of selling your book. </p> <p> If you&#8217;ve got good content that could help or entertain a lot of people, you might want to consider book writing as a form of potential passive income. </p> <h3> <span> 13. Earn Income From Affiliate Marketing</span> </h3> <p> Do you have a blog or website? Or are you thinking about starting one? Many blog owners make money by selling affiliate links on their blogs. This is a great way to earn passive income.</p> <p> Here&#8217;s how it works. You link to a product or service on your blog. Then, when someone purchases that product or service through your link, you get paid. </p> <p> Some people are <strong> making over $50,000 per month</strong> like Michelle Schroeder-Gardner, who teaches others how to make money online with her course<strong> Making Sense of Affiliate Marketing .</strong> </p> <p> Websites are easy to start, too, if you don&#8217;t already have one. In fact, I can show you how to start a blog in less than ten minutes. </p> <p> You&#8217;ll need to get hosting service for your blog so it can be seen on the internet, but that&#8217;s inexpensive when you get a deal. <strong> Click here to get special pricing of $2.95/month with Bluehost.</strong> </p> <p> Blogging can be great way to make money from home . You just need a computer, internet service and engaging content on your blog.</p> <h3> <span> 14. Start a Lead Generation Website</span> </h3> <p> Another way to make passive income is to create a lead generation website. The point of a lead generation website is to pass leads on to local businesses. You can also use your page to advertise. </p> <p> For instance, let&#8217;s say you want to create leads for local realtors. You could start a blog that talks about owning a home or about real estate investing .</p> <p> The site would contain links where people could contact you if they wanted more information. Then you&#8217;d pass that lead on to local real estate agents.</p> <p> This is what&#8217;s considered a &#8220;warm&#8221; lead. It&#8217;s not total cold calling. Instead, the person came to your site and is seeking out more information. Professionals in any arena will typically be excited about warm leads.</p> <p> However, it&#8217;s important to know that making money this way requires your articles to be high ranking in Google searches. And that means you&#8217;d have to learn about search engine optimization.</p> <h3> <span> 15. Sell Products on Amazon</span> </h3> <p> A lot of people are earning passive income by setting up a shop on Amazon. </p> <p> You have the option to sell your own products on Amazon and ship them yourself. But that&#8217;s not true passive income.</p> <p> Instead, you could have Amazon send out the products for you. I have a friend who has done really well with this. He earns well above the six-figure mark selling his products online.</p> <h3> <span> 16. Share Your Knowing Via an Online Course</span> </h3> <p> Do you have information you can share that would help others? Maybe you know how to kill it in investing or paying off debt. Or perhaps you can teach someone a skill.</p> <p> You can pass that information on to others by creating an online course. Your course can include a variety of teaching techniques. </p> <p> You can do it all via video, or via e-books or emails. Once the course is created, any sale is passive income for you. You can design the course so that the information is automatically sent to the customer after they pay. </p> <p> The money you charge for this digital product goes into your pocket. Platforms like <strong> Teachable </strong> can do all the heavy lifting for you when creating your course.</p> <h3> <span> 17. Create YouTube Videos</span> </h3> <p> I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard of or probably even watch some of these people making big bucks by posting YouTube videos. They post a video, and the video contains ads. </p> <p> As the video creator, you earn money from the ads within the videos you create. The key to making money on YouTube is growing a large audience.</p> <p> You&#8217;ll want to spend some time reaching out to people who like similar content to what you publish on YouTube. Ask them to subscribe to your channel. Doing this will increase your YouTube following.</p> <p> Once the initial work is done, you&#8217;ve got a passive income source on your hands.</p> <p> Note that you&#8217;ll need to make a lot of videos (100 or more) to really make some serious cash at this business.</p> <h3> <span> 18. Start a Business or Buy An Existing Business </span> </h3> <p> What about owning a business as a passive income source? You can start a new business or purchase an existing business. </p> <p> The way to make passive income from starting a business is to be sure you&#8217;re hiring the right people to run your business. And it doesn&#8217;t necessarily take a lot of cash to start a business. </p> <p> For instance, you might want to check out the book, <strong> $100 Startup by Chris Guillebeau .</strong> Chris wrote about dozens of businesses that started up for very little and are now earning six figures or more each year. </p> <h3> <span> 19. Open Your Own Vending Machine Business</span> </h3> <p> Here&#8217;s an example of a potential business you can own. Corporations and other businesses such as gyms or dance studios love having vending machines available for clients or workers.</p> <p> You can visit local businesses to see if they&#8217;ll let you install vending machines their clients can use. If you have the right types of snacks in your machines, you could make some big money.</p> <p> Once you get approval to install the machines, ask workers or clients what types of snacks they want in the machines. This information could help you increase sales.</p> <p> To make this a truly passive income source, you can hire people to restock the machines for you. </p> <h3> <span> 20. Sell Your Photos to a Stock Photo Company</span> </h3> <p> Are you good at taking pictures? How about earning passive income with your photos? </p> <p> Companies and website owners purchase stock photos from sites such as <strong> Deposit Photos</strong> to use for their online stores and blogs.</p> <p> Open a Deposit Photos account, and once your photos are approved, clients can begin downloading them for use. You get paid each time someone purchases one of your photos for use. </p> <p> The more photos you have uploaded on the site, the more money you can earn. <strong> Note that photos that contain people doing everyday things are the ones that earn the most money.</strong> </p> <h3> <span> 21. Create a Mobile App</span> </h3> <p> Are you good at tech stuff? Do you have some <strong> unique ideas for mobile apps</strong> ? Why not use those skills to earn some passive income? </p> <p> Once the app is created and published, you earn money every time someone downloads your app.</p> <p> Every app on your phone is making money for somebody, somewhere. For instance, Joel Comm made over <strong> $1Million from his iFart app .</strong> </p> <p> And imagine the kind of money people are making from gaming apps such as Candy Crush. </p> <p> You might not get to the million-dollar mark, but even if your app brings in a few hundred dollars a month, that&#8217;s still some decent money. </p> <h3> <span> 22. Put Ads on Your Car</span> </h3> <p> Did you know some companies will pay you just for driving as you normally do every day? If you live in a major metropolitan area and do a decent amount of driving, you could earn money by having advertisements on your car.</p> <p> Companies such as <strong> Wrapify </strong> wrap your car with ads and then pay you for your daily driving. Usually, the companies want vehicles that are in good shape with no dents or rust. These types of cars are easier to make advertising wraps adhere to.</p> <h3> <span> 23. Buy a Business That Operates Online</span> </h3> <p> When you own an online business you can work from anywhere in the world. If you&#8217;re not interested in doing the work of starting an online business from scratch, you can buy an existing online business.</p> <p> Companies like <strong> Biz Buy Sell </strong> list hundreds of online businesses for sale. The businesses range in price and in the genre. </p> <p> If you can find a business that aligns with your talents and skills, you could make some serious passive income. As with any business ownership, hiring the right people is key to making it truly passive income. </p> <h3> <span> 24. Buy a Laundromat</span> </h3> <p> Owning a laundromat is another idea for passive income. Cities everywhere have laundromats for people who don&#8217;t have in-house laundry facilities. </p> <p> <strong> Here is how you could make owning a laundromat true passive income: </strong> </p> Buy an existing laundromat business from someone interested in selling Hire a reliable and trustworthy person to manage the store Take home a paycheck <p> Start-up costs for laundromats can be pretty high, as commercial washers and dryers aren&#8217;t cheap. For that reason, you&#8217;ll probably be better off financially if you buy an existing laundromat business. </p> <h3> <span> 25. Purchase or Open a Batting Cage</span> </h3> <p> One business you could start-up for passive income would be a batting cage facility. Baseball is one of the most popular sports for kids in America. However, there aren&#8217;t a ton of batting cage facilities in most areas.</p> <p> Starting a batting cage from scratch can be very costly. You&#8217;ll need a building, and the equipment to run the store. Buying an existing batting cage might be a better bet if you can find one. </p> <p> Again, you&#8217;d have to find a good manager to do the work of managing the store. If you like sports, this might be a great passive income source for you.</p> <h3> <span> 26. Use Your Graphic Design Skills</span> </h3> <p> Are you good at graphic design? Sites such as Redbub b le allow you to upload your witty design ideas and then create t-shirts, coffee mugs, laptop covers, etc.</p> <p> You might have some ideas for great sayings that can go on shirts or mugs. Or just great designs. The cool thing about sites like Redbubble is that all you have to do is create your store and upload your designs.</p> <p> They handle all shipping, payment and customer service. When your designs sell, they send you a monthly check for your portion of the profit. </p> <h3> <span> 27. Invest in Bond or CD Laddering</span> </h3> <p> Bond and CD laddering is when you own a bunch of bonds and/or Certificates of Deposit. You spread out their maturity dates so they come due at different times of the year. Then you&#8217;ll have cash coming in from them throughout the year. </p> <p> Note that bonds and CDs typically don&#8217;t earn as high of a return as other investments. However, they are usually much lower risk too. Bond and CD laddering can provide a sure and steady passive income source for you. </p> <h3> <span> 28. Rent Your Stuff to Others</span> </h3> <p> What about earning passive income by renting out stuff you own? <strong> Craigslist </strong> can be a great place to advertise your items for rent. </p> <p> <strong> Products that you could rent out:</strong> </p> Tools and ladders Party tents Tables and chairs Utility trailers Log splitters Cleaning equipment Snowmobiles ATV&#8217;s <p> <strong> You can even rent out your car when you are not using it with a company like Turo.</strong> </p> <p> If you&#8217;re going to choose this passive income source, be sure to have all renters sign a contract. That way, you protect yourself and your equipment in case something goes wrong.</p> <p> I&#8217;d consider charging a refundable security deposit to protect yourself in case someone damages equipment too. </p> <h2> <span> Summary</span> </h2> <p> Passive income sources aren&#8217;t just for the wealthy. Everyone has to start somewhere. And there are many passive income sources you can get started in for less than $1,000. </p> <p> Don&#8217;t let a lack of knowledge stop you from achieving your goal to have passive income even if you want a lot of it! Do further research about the passive income ideas we&#8217;ve mentioned here. </p> <p> Decide on four or five that seem right for you. Then get to work earning some passive monthly income streams! </p> <p> <strong> Which of these passive income ideas appeal to you?</strong> </p> <span> </span> <span> 48627</span> <span> shares</span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <span> <span> </span> </span> <h3> Author</h3> <h4> Deacon Hayes </h4> <p> Deacon Hayes is a financial expert, speaker, and podcaster.

I have a friend who is researching the batting cage idea.</p> <p> <span> Laurie</span> </p> <p> We&#8217;ve done some work on it too, Brian, and it seems like a super profitable idea. I wish we had the cash to open one here!</p> <p> <span> Deacon Hayes</span> </p> <p> Maybe once we sell 100,000 copies of our personal finance curriculum, you can open one then. 🙂</p> <p> <span> Laurie @thefrugalfarmer</span> </p> <p> LOL, you&#8217;re a funny one, Deacon. 🙂</p> <p> <span> Deacon Hayes</span> </p> <p> That is awesome! Let me know if he actually follows through with it. I am curious how the numbers workout from a net income standpoint of owning a batting cage.</p> <p> <span> Erika</span> </p> <p> Yeah, I have been looking into a batting cage for a while now, and I&#8217;m really considering trying my hand at it!</p> <p> <span> stephen</span> </p> <p> I knew a family who lost the business and their home from one lawsuit in their batting cage business. Make sure you check out every single bit about it first, especially insurances and their costs. Know exactly what the policies cover, do not skimp here.<br/> This applies to every business of course, but you would be surprised how many people treat insurance as an after thought.</p> <p> <span> Luke Fitzgerald</span> </p> <p> These are great ideas! I really like how you mentioned, &#8220;get out of debt&#8221;, as passive income. I&#8217;ve never thought about it like that before. I&#8217;m always trying to think of new ways to persuade people to get out of debt. This is a great way to flip someones perspective. Debt reduction really is passive income!</p> <p> <span> Deacon Hayes</span> </p> <p> It is amazing how much more money we had coming in every month to work with when we paid off our debt. Although it is not &#8220;technically&#8221; passive income, it is a great way to increase your cash flow.</p> <p> <span> DAllen</span> </p> <p> I call it, &#8220;mirrored passive income&#8221;.</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> That&#8217;s a good description.</p> <p> <span> Niomi</span> </p> <p> I love this list thanks for posting it! I&#8217;ve been learning a lot more about passive incomes lately and this list included several ideas I hadn&#8217;t thought of before. Thanks again!</p> <p> <span> Laurie</span> </p> <p> Thanks, Niomi!! I&#8217;m glad you are finding the post helpful!</p> <p> <span> Ashley</span> </p> <p> I am in the process of writing a book and starting an online business as well as an at home business. I loved this post because it solidified about 6 of my existing ideas but gave me some resources that could help. How do I get my book edited and published professionally though? Isn&#8217;t this needed in order to sell?</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> Try going to our post bout how to get paid to read books. Even though editing is not what this post is about, there are several companies that might do book editing such as Kirkus. I hope this helps and good luck on your book!</p> <p> <span> Kevin Phillips</span> </p> <p> Looking at all these people that are so called &#8220;Affiliate Marketing Experts&#8221;, it seems the way they actually make money is to sell you a course on how to affiliate market rather than affiliate marketing. Sell 50 of those courses a month worldwide and that&#8217;s an impressive income. Some people are selling courses for $1000!!!</p> <p> <span> Laura Harris</span> </p> <p> I love this list, Laurie! I&#8217;m in the process of figuring out what eBook to write. It would be so fun to do a course someday too. Thanks for validating my thoughts with this boost of encouragement!</p> <p> <span> Deacon Hayes</span> </p> <p> Hey, Laura! That is awesome that you are planning on writing an eBook. What are you thinking the book will be about?</p> <p> <span> Laura Harris</span> </p> <p> Hi, Deacon! I&#8217;m a financial coach and a mom, so I&#8217;d love to write a book that will encourage people to get out of debt and smash their financial goals so they can travel the world with their kids or start new hobbies or just be able to come home before dinner every night. We&#8217;ll see. </p> <p> It&#8217;s kind of you to ask!</p> <p> <span> Cindi Pieniazek</span> </p> <p> Can I get access to your book as soon as you are done? I have M.S and not one for collecting from the government. I want to do this by myself. So, I would love to read your ebook and any advice you have.</p> <p> <span> Laurie</span> </p> <p> That&#8217;s great, Laura! You definitely have tons of great info to share with how well you and Dontae have done.</p> <p> <span> Laura Harris</span> </p> <p> You&#8217;re always so encouraging, Laurie. I really appreciate that. Perhaps I&#8217;ll get started on that sooner than I thought. 🙂</p> <p> <span> Casey</span> </p> <p> These are great ideas I will try to experience some of these.</p> <p> <span> DivHut</span> </p> <p> There are so many ways to generate a passive income stream these days. Though some of the items listed are not that passive. Maintaining a blog takes time and work and so does managing real estate. One of my favorite ways of generating passive income is via dividend growth investing. Thanks for compiling this list.</p> <p> <span> Laurie @thefrugalfarmer</span> </p> <p> Dividend income is a great passive income form. Blog income is passive in some capacity in that once a post with an affiliate link is posted, it only takes a click and a purchase by another party to produce the income. Thanks for weighing in we appreciate it!</p> <p> <span> Chella</span> </p> <p> Writing is definitely on high demand now with many small businesses in need of online marketing. Thank you for mentioning creating an online course too! Sites like Udemy and Udacity are worthy trying out.</p> <p> <span> Laurie @thefrugalfarmer</span> </p> <p> Thanks, Chella! Yes, writing has been lucrative for me and I&#8217;ve enjoyed being able to work at home and still bring in income.</p> <p> <span> Bodhi Clifford</span> </p> <p> I made a little over $500 USD last month from passive income. 97% of that comes from two Amazon sites I built but can&#8217;t seem to find motivation to work on anymore. I am slowly working on creating my first product now. It&#8217;s going to be an online course.</p> <p> <span> Deacon Hayes</span> </p> <p> That is awesome that you made $500 last month. Way to go! I know how you feel. I find it hard to get motivated from time to time, but then I start a new project and I am all in.</p> <p> <span> Brendan</span> </p> <p> What a great list!</p> <p> I&#8217;m almost debt free so I&#8217;m excited about the &#8220;pay-raise&#8221; I&#8217;ll recieve! I especially like the content creation ideas (book publishing, online courses, etc.) because of the relatively low overhead. Once it is made, it never has to stop working for you!</p> <p> <span> Laurie @thefrugalfarmer</span> </p> <p> Congrats on almost reaching debt freedom!! You could definitely do a book about your experience and help increase your income that way, too. Good luck, Brendan!</p> <p> <span> Nicole</span> </p> <p> I&#8217;m one of those weird people who actually loves to edit content. Whether it be a report or an essay, I feel a strange joy in reconstructing clumsy sentences and ensuring language and layout consistency. Is there any income to be generated from THAT? lol</p> <p> <span> Deacon Hayes</span> </p> <p> Hey Nicole! You could definitely make money at that. There are plenty of places that hire proofreaders where they will pay you to read and edit content. Let me know if you end up doing that!</p> <p> <span> Venice</span> </p> <p> Hi Nicole,<br/> It’s nice to have finally found a twin! I naturally LOVE editing content too. We’re both word nerds that’s what I call it anyway. I would love to know if you find anything good to put your talents to work! I really enjoyed this list. Keep them coming! Thank you!</p> <p> <span> Bill</span> </p> <p> Deacon</p> <p> A drop shipping business is it something that has to be worked 24 7? The reason I ask is because I have a full time job and was wondering. I want something that won&#8217;t take up all my time. I mean, I already work 15 hours a day, Monday thru Friday. I want to start out slow and learn as I go. Any info would be helpful. Thanks in advance.</p> <p> <span> Deacon Hayes</span> </p> <p> Hi Bill,</p> <p> I have only dabbled in drop-shipping before when I had an eCommerce platform 6 years ago or so. I think it is something that you could do on the side, but you would want to do in depth research on the industry you want to get into before setting up shop. It may be a little less passive up front, but over time you could take your hands off the wheel.</p> <p> <span> Donna</span> </p> <p> Thanks for posting such great ideas! I&#8217;m interested in a dropshipping business. Exactly how does one get an opportunity to sell and work with manufacturers?</p> <p> <span> Deacon Hayes</span> </p> <p> Hi, Donna. There is a lot to it when starting a drop shipping business, so I figured I should point you to the best resource I know. This guy is doing great things in the eCommerce world and shares how you can get started at eCommerceFuel in his post about how to start a drop shipping business.</p> <p> <span> Deacon Hayes</span> </p> <p> Thanks. I&#8217;m glad you found it helpful!</p> <p> <span> Barthosyn</span> </p> <p> Does it mean that these online jobs and the passive income can be done by anybody around the globe?</p> <p> <span> Amina</span> </p> <p> Hi,<br/> I am an English major and a herbalist with so many ideas and no extra income to fulfill them. I recently started renting my extra apartment in the attic with Airbnb. It&#8217;s amazing how fast I accumulated some money for few hours of work between guests. Now I want to persue all my dreams of opening an online herbal store, publishing my ebook of treating Ulcerative Colitis with herbs, blogs, and videos, and pretty much all of the ideas mentioned here. I will save this article as its really helpful for whomever needs some ideas <br/> Thanks for sharing and the encouragement <br/> Great job. It can be done, people!</p> <p> <span> Deacon Hayes</span> </p> <p> Wow, I&#8217;m glad to hear about your success with AirBnb. I love that site and we use it nearly every time we travel. I wish you all the best with your ebook and online store. Let me know if there is anything I can do to help!</p> <p> <span> Sandra</span> </p> <p> Hi Amina,<br/> Do you have anything published on your herbal treatments or a page?</p> <p> <span> Lori</span> </p> <p> I used care.com and all I got were scammers.</p> <p> <span> Deacon Hayes</span> </p> <p> That is interesting as I have never heard that before. What were you looking to do, babysitting or pet sitting?</p> <p> <span> Emily</span> </p> <p> I just wanted to say how nice it is to see such a positive exchange between strangers on the Internet. Seriously, not only was this article (list) motivating and well-drafted, the tiny little community of readers truly were a pleasant crescendo I found to be the cause of an inward smile. Thank you, everyone, and good luck to you all with your passive income efforts!! 🙂 </p> <p> PS-If anyone needs an Equine Massage Practitioner in CO Springs, I&#8217;m raring to go!! 🙂</p> <p> <span> Deacon Hayes</span> </p> <p> Hey, Emily. Thanks for the kinds words. It is all about helping each other reach our goals in life, so I am glad you found it helpful. Good luck to you as well!</p> <p> <span> Dave @ www.AffordEverything.com</span> </p> <p> This list is awesome. The idea about renting your stuff out is great. I&#8217;m probably shooting my self in the foot here, but if someone were to make an app similar to Airbnb ,but to rent out your stuff, it would probably make them rich. 😉 This is a great post!</p> <p> <span> Deacon Hayes</span> </p> <p> Haha, that is too funny. I wanted to make an app back in the day called &#8220;MyShares&#8221; (You can probably tell how I cam up with the name at the time). The idea was that I would loan out books and DVD&#8217;s and then would never get them back. Then I thought, how cool would it be if I could rent those items out and that would motivate people to bring them back. Obviously, books and DVD&#8217;s are cheap, so this isn&#8217;t the money maker. The idea that would probably make the most money would be things like tools, ATVs, etc.</p> <p> <span> Joel</span> </p> <p> You could have your app developed if you aren&#8217;t knowledgeable in app development. Although, this would require some cash because you would be hiring an outsourcing company to build it for you while you do the marketing.</p> <p> <span> Danielle</span> </p> <p> Hi. Can anyone recommend a really good and affordable app builder?</p> <p> <span> Robert</span> </p> <p> I always encourage people to start their own blog and make some extra money via affiliate marketing (#8 on the list above).</p> <p> Adding to the first on your list (crowdfunded real estate), those that read this article should look into real estate investment trusts (REIT&#8217;s). It definitely fits the definition of crowdfunded real estate.</p> <p> One of the most appealing options, particularly for millennials, would be #12 on your list (create a Blog/Youtube channel). The videos can be about anything that interests you, from your daily makeup routine (with affiliate links to the products you use), recipes (what you eat each day) or as you mention, instructional videos (again with affiliate links to the products you use). Once you gain a large following and viewership, you can earn via Adsense on YouTube.</p> <p> Passive income (with a little effort) can be a great way to earn while you sleep!</p> <p> <span> Deacon Hayes</span> </p> <p> Affiliate advertising is one of my favorite sources of residual income. I have articles that I wrote years ago that still make money every month. </p> <p> As far as REIT&#8217;s, those can be a decent investment. However, I have seen some go under, so make sure to research them thoroughly before investing.</p> <p> I would love to make more money with my Youtube channel. However, I still have a small following of around 300 people. What size audience do you think would be enough to make around $1,000 per month?</p> <p> <span> Renee Hinmon</span> </p> <p> This article was very insightful. I&#8217;m working on creating a blog now so that I can create online courses as well as post affiliate links. </p> <p> Thank you for sharing!</p> <p> <span> Deacon Hayes</span> </p> <p> I&#8217;m glad that you found helpful, Renee. Please keep me posted on your progress and if you have any questions at all, please don&#8217;t hesitate to reach out!</p> <p> <span> Vlad</span> </p> <p> Hi Deacon,</p> <p> About buying an existing online business: do you have any tips about what is important to look for when you choosing an online business?</p> <p> This is a really good article and some really useful ideas. Thanks.</p> <p> <span> Deacon Hayes</span> </p> <p> When I purchase an existing online business, I look for cash flow over the past year and where the money comes from. I want the sources to be more passive so that it does not take a lot of my time. Also, typically I will make an offer that is 18 24 months of profit so that I know that I will get my money back within the next two years. I hope that helps!</p> <p> <span> Vlad</span> </p> <p> Thank you for your help, Deacon. I have found a business/website, and now I am negotiating the price, trying to get it for the 18 months of profit.</p> <p> Thank you, Deacon.</p> <p> <span> Chelsea</span> </p> <p> I use Turo for my car and it is great! The day after I put it on, it was already booked for 2 weeks solid. I have the money going into a separate checking account that is dedicated to my car payment and insurance payment. It pretty much pays for itself!</p> <p> <span> Deacon Hayes</span> </p> <p> That is awesome to hear your success with Turo. I know a guy who does something similar with his RV and he said it pays for itself as well. That&#8217;s not too shabby.</p> <p> <span> Leah</span> </p> <p> This is a great comprehensive list. I saw some new ideas! Thanks.</p> <p> <span> Deacon Hayes</span> </p> <p> I&#8217;m glad to hear you got some new ideas out of it. I tried to make as comprehensive of a list for passive income ideas as I could.</p> <p> <span> Tam</span> </p> <p> How do you rent your car ? Di you worry about miles? How much do you rent it for? What kind of a deposit and collateral do you take?</p> <p> <span> Samar</span> </p> <p> That&#8217;s a nice read! I love your many tangible ways mentioned to make passive income unlike certain people trying to recruit others by mentioning network marketing and trying to get them to join up and sell products like Amway, Avon, Mary Kay, Cutco or 5Linx. People get sucked into wealth and profits and become influenced joiners from the use pressure tactics. </p> <p> Would you say it is a total waste of time, a pyramid scheme, and a wrong sense of passive income and network marketing when joining these companies and being pushed to sell products? </p> <p> With passive income, it only makes sense to receive tangible earnings.</p> <p> <span> Emily Brookes</span> </p> <p> These are such great ideas! I&#8217;m trying to create passive income that I can live off of at the moment, so I&#8217;m keeping my fingers crossed . I&#8217;m also loving the challenge!</p> <p> <span> Deacon Hayes</span> </p> <p> Thanks! What passive income opportunities are you currently seeking out?</p> <p> <span> Ben Anderson</span> </p> <p> Deacon, I&#8217;m so happy I found this blog. I&#8217;ve been trying to increase my passive income in multiple ways and now I feel like I have some great new tools to do that! I think I&#8217;m going to look more into crowd-funded real estate. I&#8217;d never heard of it and definitely didn&#8217;t know it could be so profitable!</p> <p> Generating a passive income was the key for my family and me to get out of debt. I&#8217;m your average American. I went to college, got a decent job, married the girl of my dreams, started a family and BOOM tens of thousands of dollars of debt. YUCK!</p> <p> I had to get out. I actually had this random Facebook ad come up in my news feed (go figure) and it eventually led me to a webinar that taught on how to start an email marketing business (which is, by the way, the most profitable form of affiliate marketing or ANY marketing for that matter). I listened through the whole 2 hours, completely mesmerized. By the end of it, I knew what I was going to be focusing on to help my family out of the pit of debt we were in and into a world free of financial stress. I didn&#8217;t know if it would actually work, but eventually it lead to EXCESS income!</p> <p> I gave it a shot. And I have NOT been disappointed. I decided to write a little bit more about it on my own blog (trufiliate.com) and I hope it can help others find the financial freedom they’ve been looking for!</p> <p> Thanks again, Deacon, for a quality blog for people like me. I&#8217;m always looking to leave a legacy for my family. 🙂</p> <p> <span> Loro</span> </p> <p> Skip the laundromat idea. It&#8217;s NOT passive. I owned two of them. It was a hell of a lot of work and problems. No thanks.</p> <p> <span> Deacon Hayes</span> </p> <p> That is good to know. I looked into buying a laundromat and it seemed very passive. However, the owner only had one employee, so if she was sick then I would have to step in. It wasn&#8217;t for me, but I am sure some people have made it work.</p> <p> <span> AG</span> </p> <p> This is a great list. I tried all kinds of ways to make extra money online. What works best for me is koocam. I teach my hobbies and sell my knowledge in every field. It&#8217;s great. 🙂</p> <p> <span> Krystal Glover</span> </p> <p> I&#8217;m definitely jumping on 3 or 4 of those right now! Hopefully I can give a good and profitable update soon!</p> <p> <span> Deacon Hayes</span> </p> <p> That is awesome! Definitely give me an update and let me know how it goes.</p> <p> <span> Sonny</span> </p> <p> I&#8217;m so interested in having passive income. But, sometimes these passive income ideas need a bigger capital budget. I&#8217;m giving only a few dollars of income monthly. So, we have to choose carefully which asset to buy or create.</p> <p> <span> Deacon Hayes</span> </p> <p> Yeah, it is true that some of these do take an up front investment to get started. However, there are several that take less than $100 to start.</p> <p> <span> Al</span> </p> <p> This is an awesome list! Thanks for putting this together!</p> <p> <span> Dottie</span> </p> <p> You can find pet sitting jobs on Care.com, but be super aware of scammers. I have gotten four scam job offers in the last 30 days. If the offer is too good to be true, it probably is.</p> <p> <span> Wallet Squirrel</span> </p> <p> Wow! What an awesome list! My favorite is the stock photography because I love photography. I have had some success there, particularly with one photo I make some decent income from. I think the key with stock photography is finding a shot that is high demand. Then, find a new unique way to frame that shot. This is the reason my St. Louis Arch photo is a top 10 on both ShutterStock and iStockPhoto. Thanks for the awesome ideas above!</p> <p> Adam</p> <p> <span> Nancy</span> </p> <p> You may want to take Pet Sitting out of it. It’s definitely not passive income. It’s not a laid back job by any means. It’s an 80 hour a week business. I run one, so I know. Overnights are fun for awhile, but then you&#8217;re sleeping in a strangers house and they have might have cameras watching every move you make.</p> <p> <span> Chris</span> </p> <p> I really appreciate the info and ideas. I love your blog!</p> <p> <span> Tim Webber</span> </p> <p> I currently use number 2. My last dividend payment was from my Coca-Cola (KO) stock paid out to shareholders on October 2nd.</p> <p> I use the Robinhood app to purchase my stock as it is free as long as you don&#8217;t cross over into day trader territory (buy, sell, buy, sell the same stock), which you won&#8217;t if you&#8217;re holding shares for dividends. </p> <p> You will receive your first share for free chosen at random by the Robinhood app, which will most likely be valued somewhere between $3 and $10. But, if you are extremely lucky, it is possible to receive one valued up to around $170 (they say). I have not personally seen one that high yet.</p> <p> In the interest of full disclosure, I too receive a free share if you use my link. However, you do have to use a referral link in order to get the free share. So if you know someone else who already has an account, feel free to get theirs. </p> <p> One last thing: if you decide to go for it, please comment below letting us all know what stock you got. Good luck to all of you. 🙂</p> <p> <span> Harpreet Kumar</span> </p> <p> I really appreciate your ideas, sir. For me, affiliate marketing is the best suited money making technique today.</p> <p> <span> Luis</span> </p> <p> Cryptocurrency trading is about a way of creating passive income. I would like to recommend Trademinator.</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> We&#8217;ll look into that. Thanks!</p> <p> <span> Arturs</span> </p> <p> I do agree that a few of these ideas are not bad, but for me the problem with some of these platforms has been that I&#8217;m not from the USA. So, I can&#8217;t operate there. It&#8217;s a really interesting possibility to get some extra bucks from doing what you would do either way, like shopping. One of the best projects so far that I have seen is FluzFluz. It&#8217;s simple and really easy to use for everyone who uses Uber, Amazo, or other apps. The best part of all is that you can get some passive income not just from your own purchases, but from other people&#8217;s as well. I hope one day it will make it here to your list. I think it&#8217;s worth it to check out.</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> We&#8217;ll look into that. Thanks for sharing!</p> <p> <span> Alican</span> </p> <p> Some of these ideas are very creative. Thanks a lot for sharing!</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> You&#8217;re welcome!</p> <p> <span> Jesse</span> </p> <p> These are all good, fun ideas. But, people should be aware that many of these are not really passive income. Building up something, building an infrastructure, and hiring someone to run the day to day operations is a business. You have employees, managing, purchasing, etc. etc.</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> It depends on how hands-on you decide to be. It is possible to hire people to handle all of the details for you.</p> <p> <span> TJ Mitch</span> </p> <p> Deacon, I like your crowdfunding idea. I think I will give it a try.<br/> Thanks for sharing. TJ Mitch at passiveincomewiz</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> Let us know how it goes!</p> <p> <span> Josh Kelnhofer</span> </p> <p> I&#8217;m very pleased to see batting cages up there! I have thought the same thing numerous times, as in my area (Indianapolis) there are hardly any and it&#8217;s a shame.</p> <p> <span> Josh Kelnhofer</span> </p> <p> I have been toying with the idea of writing a book for some time. I was surprised you didn&#8217;t have an affiliate link (lol) to the publisher you used, or provide a little more guidance on proceeding.<br/> I feel there are so many scam publishers online. They remind me of the cheesy &#8220;patents for inventors&#8221; commercials you see.</p> <p> <span> Lars Bunsen</span> </p> <p> That is the best article I&#8217;ve read about this! There are some ways I never thought about, like vending machines. I&#8217;ll definitely have to try some of them, but I would recommend using this book too. I&#8217;ve made a lot of passive income with this.</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> That&#8217;s awesome!</p> <p> <span> Brian</span> </p> <p> This is a great post. I agree with the above comments that this has been an encouraging group to get some feedback from. The one that jumped out at me the most was #13. Has anyone here started their own business and outsourced the majority of the day to day stuff so that it really does become a source of passive income?</p> <p> <span> Lili</span> </p> <p> It is never too late to start making income online. A smart man said: Stop dreaming, start acting. Whatever method you choose, stick with it. If you don&#8217;t have one, stick with me and it will be the best decision you ever made.<br/> 🙂</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> That&#8217;s another possibility.</p> <p> <span> James</span> </p> <p> I just started out with Affiliate Marketing (idea # 8) and it is not as easy as people make out to be. For me, the hardest part so far, is learning Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and driving traffic to my website. I&#8217;m only 3 months into it, but I am confident that the site will begin to generate some incom., I have to give it 6-9 months, so we&#8217;ll see.</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> Although I&#8217;m sure more people may be getting into cryptocurrencies all the time, it may be a while before it&#8217;s something regular people pursue as a means of income. However, for some it may be a way to make more money, so I don&#8217;t completely disagree with your first statement.</p> <p> <span> Ajish Cheriyan</span> </p> <p> These are 24 awesome tips. Thank you for sharing the info. Making a passive income will really be a great help for me.</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> I&#8217;m glad we could help you out!</p> <p> <span> David Bauer</span> </p> <p> #25. Get paid for your good credit by renting out your authorized user spots on your credit card. I know it sounds sketchy, but once you educate yourself you will learn it&#8217;s perfectly legal and safe. If you have good credit, you can make thousands per month. </p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> That sounds rather interesting. I&#8217;m sure it carries some risks as well as rewards. Thanks for sharing this idea.</p> <p> <span> David Bauer</span> </p> <p> It&#8217;s definitely not risk-free and not for everybody. The biggest risk is having your credit card closed down for shuffling authorized users on and off too often, which, depending on your situation, may not be too big of a deal. If you have the right credit profile (old, high limit cards) it can be a very nice extra income stream.</p> <p> <span> Yosh</span> </p> <p> David Bauer,</p> <p> Could you provide more info or a website for renting out credit scores?</p> <p> Thanks</p> <p> <span> David Bauer</span> </p> <p> Tradelinessupply</p> <p> <span> Megan</span> </p> <p> This is an excellent article! Not only does it list the idea, but the reference website to get started on each one. Thank you.</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> Your welcome! I hope it helps you out.</p> <p> <span> Jordan</span> </p> <p> Hi, Deacon. I am a newbie in this passive income thing, but everything I read here seems obvious to me. Why not create passive income, right?<br/> So I started googling about making passive income via the internet. I found this article which seems that it is probably very new. But in the ebook there is great information about passive income, at least in my POV (newbie POV). Is this legit and does it actually work? I want to expand on that because my 9 5 s*cks.</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> Well, Jordan, I hate to totally burst your bubble. However, almost nothing worth having is actually free or easily had. So, to put it another way, it may not be possible to have a different job or create passive income without some work.<br/> Yes, you can make money through affiliate marketing. But you also have to have followers who are interested in what you are advertising. That&#8217;s where the hard work comes in through building your audience and following.<br/> Now, if you decide to try it and end up lucky enough to make tons of legitimate money with very little work, good for you. But I would definitely be cautious. Read the fine print of any deals you are considering.</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> We&#8217;re glad you found it helpful. Thanks for your feedback.</p> <p> <span> Asmara</span> </p> <p> This is one of the best articles I&#8217;ve found as I&#8217;ve looked for ways to make money while I sleep. </p> <p> I am on number 14 and 19 now. I already have three online businesses. One is already streaming income while the other two are in their infancy stage. LOL.</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> Good for you! I wish you luck with them.</p> <p> <span> Ebony</span> </p> <p> Hi! It would be great if you could make these links open up in a new window so we don&#8217;t lose our place in this article if we wander off! Just a suggestion. </p> <p> Thanks for these tips. I&#8217;m definitely going to look into them.</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> Thanks for your suggestions. I will consider them. Good luck with your passive income. I hope you have success!</p> <p> <span> David</span> </p> <p> These are great ideas and this is a good list. Thanks for posting!</p> <p> I would add two opinions:</p> <p> 1. The batting cage idea is very risky. I&#8217;ve seen many of them close over the years and it is not anything close to passive income if you want to keep the business going. You have to continually promote it and target youth leagues, coaches, schools etc to catch all of the new players who grow up and want to play. I&#8217;ve played at probably 8 batting cages over the years and 7 of them closed.</p> <p> 2. Drop shipping is very risky. You need to verify your manufacturer&#8217;s ability to deliver on its promises. All it takes is a handful of orders that don&#8217;t ship on time and you get a bunch of cancellations and angry customers. Do a lot of research before trying this idea you&#8217;ll find out the risk involved.</p> <p> Thanks for the list!</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> Thanks for posting your opinions and advice for other readers to consider. We appreciate your comments!</p> <p> <span> Sandra Clarke</span> </p> <p> This is a great article! Thanks for taking the time to put it together. I&#8217;ve shared it with friends and family.<br/> These are great responses and interactions.</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> Thank you. I&#8217;m glad you like it!</p> <p> <span> Vipul Baraskar</span> </p> <p> Can I use these ideas if I am 17 now?</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> You should at least be able to do a couple of them. For instance, you might be able to write a book or house sit. Pet sitting is another option. But we have other posts about jobs for teens that might help too. Check them out on our site and good luck!</p> <p> <span> Christie</span> </p> <p> This is one of the best articles I have read in awhile. You offer great ideas for students and those looking for extra income. My whole family can each try on our own to combine our effects. Thank you.</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> Thanks for your comments. I wish you great luck with your passive income efforts.</p> <p> <span> Hailey</span> </p> <p> That&#8217;s a great idea about the T-shirts. 🙂 I always have plenty of &#8220;stupid&#8221; ideas but never got around to making them. I opened up a simple e-merchandise site recently *hooray*. It&#8217;s not as hard as it seems now. I got some free courses from BitDegree, used WordPress, and bam. I wanted to come back and thank you for the idea!</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> I&#8217;m glad you are having luck with your e-store. Thanks for your comments!</p> <p> <span> Meredith Smith</span> </p> <p> The list of residual income ideas you have here is incredibly great. Each one of them has the potential to make you money frequently. But I want to add that being a virtual assistant – VA, is a remarkable way to make money online, as it involves a variety of jobs under the VA platform.</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> Yes, you can make a lot of money as a VA. I&#8217;m not sure you would generally describe it as passive income or residual income, though. I suppose you could if you have someone else hired beneath you to do the actual work and you just find and contract with the clients.</p> <p> <span> Jay</span> </p> <p> Hey there,</p> <p> There&#8217;s some really great information here. About 6 or 7 of these I will be checking out. It seems strange that I haven&#8217;t heard of some of these ideas. but you can&#8217;t know everything 🙂</p> <p> Thanks for sharing and take care.</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> Thanks for your comments. I hope the one&#8217;s you check into work for you!</p> <p> <span> Nelle</span> </p> <p> Thanks for the list of great information. I really appreciate it.</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> You&#8217;re very welcome!</p> <p> <span> Doug</span> </p> <p> This is a terrible list. I think a 10 year can figure that out. It states the obvious. How about a list that&#8217;s not like the rest on the internet. Several of the items on your list are not passive! What a joke.</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> Not everyone feels the way you do and some do not know about some of these ideas. However, we value your opinion and thank you for your comments.</p> <p> <span> David Lee</span> </p> <p> Hi,<br/> What a fantastic post! This is so chock full of useful information. I can’t wait to dig deep and start utilizing the resources you have given me.</p> <p> <span> Faith Pepper</span> </p> <p> With two babies, and deserted by my husband, I had no choice but to work for myself. At the beginning it was hard. However, I soon realized that this was the best thing to have ever happened to me. I struggled with EVERYTHING to begin with, but as I mastered new skills I began making a good living without even leaving the comfort of my own home. Now I wouldn&#8217;t change my lifestyle for the world.</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> That&#8217;s great! How wonderful to raise your kids and earn money to support them at the same time.</p> <p> <span> Pam</span> </p> <p> Faith Pepper,<br/> That&#8217;s great that you were able to stay home with your babies. But how did you start to make your passive income?</p> <p> <span> Pamela Kirenzi</span> </p> <p> This is a lovely article! There are nice comments, too. For once it&#8217;s not an angry crowd!! Now, what are your thoughts on network marketing? Isn&#8217;t it a good source of passive income? I intend to venture into one, called World Ventures.</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> Some people have good luck with network marketing. However, I don&#8217;t know that it is really considered passive income.</p> <p> <span> Sidwell</span> </p> <p> This is a good read. Thank you for writing this article and to everyone that shared their ideas and experiences. God bless you all.</p> <p> <span> Brad</span> </p> <p> I&#8217;m sure these are all great ideas if you live in the US. But, I live in South Africa and none of these will work unless you earn a lot of money already or own a house or car which are things not many people here can afford. Does anyone know of a list of ways to create passive income in South Africa?</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> I actually went back to the post and looked closer. Out of the first 13 ways listed, only one requires that you have house. None of the rest require you to have a house or a car. Of course, there are 11 more ideas in addition to those first 13 and some of those do require you to start with an investment. However, there&#8217;s nearly always a way to create passive income if you are willing to put in the time and work involved. If you do not find something that works for you in this post, check out our other posts. If you&#8217;re constantly on the lookout for ways to create passive income I&#8217;m betting you will find a way that works for you. Be diligent and I bet you can do it, even in South Africa. Good luck!</p> <p> <span> Illy</span> </p> <p> Your list looks so do-able! Thank you.</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> I’m glad it could help! You’re welcome.</p> <p> <span> Deacon</span> </p> <p> That’s awesome! Blogging is definitely one of the best ways to make passive income! Best of luck!</p> <p> <span> Crystal C</span> </p> <p> This was great to read! Haven&#8217;t heard of a lot of these! I will be researching the ones that suit my creativeness and passions the most!
